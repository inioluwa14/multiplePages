        <h1 id="name">ANNE FRANK</h1>
        <p>Annelies Marie "Anne" Frank (German pronunciation: [ˈanəˌliːs maˈʁiː ˈʔanə ˈfʁaŋk] (About this soundlisten), 
          Dutch: [ˈɑnəˌlis maːˈri ˈʔɑnə ˈfrɑŋk]; 12 June 1929 – February or March 1945) was a German-Dutch diarist of 
          Jewish heritage. One of the most discussed Jewish victims of the Holocaust, she gained fame posthumously with 
          the 1947 publication of The Diary of a Young Girl (originally Het Achterhuis in Dutch; English: The Secret Annex)
          , in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944, during the German occupation of the Netherlands 
          in World War II. It is one of the world's best-known books and has been the basis for several plays and films.
        </p>
        <p> Born in Frankfurt, Germany, she lived most of her life in or near Amsterdam, Netherlands, having moved there 
          with her family at the age of four and a half when Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party gained control over Germany. 
          Born a German national, she lost her citizenship in 1941 and thus became stateless. By May 1940, the Franks were 
          rapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands. As persecutions of the Jewish population 
          increased in July 1942, the Franks went into hiding in some concealed rooms behind a bookcase in the building 
          where Anne's father, Otto Frank, worked. From then until the family's arrest by the Gestapo in August 1944, 
          she kept a diary she had received as a birthday present, and wrote in it regularly. Following their arrest, 
          the Franks were transported to concentration camps. On November 1 1944,[2] Anne and her sister, Margot, 
          were transferred from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they died (probably of typhus) 
          a few months later. They were originally estimated by the Red Cross to have died in March, with Dutch 
          authorities setting 31 March as their official date of death, but research by the Anne Frank House in 2015 
          suggests it is more likely that they died in February.</p>
